					Indo-Euro Synchronization is an initiative created by a group of experienced technical and business professionals to
					connect India and Europe closer together. With our diverse and wide set of knowledge about both the Indian and European
					academic and business environment, our aim is to form a technological transfer bridge between all participants. Through
					our activities, we strive to create a better technological future by enabling closer collaboration and knowledge exchange
					between universities, companies, supporting organizations and students from India and Europe.
					We believe that three elements are required for a closer common development: Educational programs, research
					partnerships and cluster collaborations.
				</p>
				<p class="flow-text" style="text-align:justify;">
					Our educational programs are executed in partnership with leading universities, allowing Indian students and professionals
					to travel to Europe. Participants gain a comprehensive insight into the local industrial situation while at the same time
					enhancing their professional skills and career prospects through additional education.	
				</p>
				<p class="flow-text" style="text-align:justify;">
					Research partnerships are enabled by connecting industrial and research institutes through common events. This broadens
					the scope and speed of technology transfer between all parties, allowing European and Indian companies to take
					advantage of each other's unique abilities and features.
				</p>
				<p class="flow-text" style="text-align:justify;">
					Cluster collaborations are encouraged on a national and supra-national level by leveraging our existing network of partners.
					By combining all three elements, we believe that we can contribute to a stronger and better world.

					<b>Research Lab Establishment – ARC</b> Universities worldwide improve their educational concepts continuously. However,
					they lack concrete training for job with hands-on experiences, which makes a
					student fit for the business life. Indo Euro Synchronization tackles this problem
					and organizes the establishment of R&D labs in India, with the worldwide
					renowned partners ‘APS GmbH – European Centre for Mechatronics’, Germany
					and ‘Steinbeis Center for Technology Transfer’, India. The aim is to enhance the
					current education by introducing concrete industrial automation concepts by
					teaching robotics at Indian universities, with access to real industrial robot.
					Further, these labs can support Indian industries including SMEs by providing
					automation solutions tested under real productionrequirements. In addition, the gap is bridged to participate at global research programs in the future.

					An initial step for the implementation, ARC has already been organizing regular student seminars in Germany including
					workshops and live experiments at APS in Germany. ARC provides to the students the access to industrial robotics under
					production conditions with remote control. An extensive exchange program for Indian faculty members guarantees the
					high quality of the educational lessons and practical courses. These practical courses allow direct control of the industrial
					robots in Germany from Indian universities. Concretely, the students learn simulating, programming and controlling the
					robots in order to test their results at these industrial robots, which are equipped with grippers, sensors, etc.
